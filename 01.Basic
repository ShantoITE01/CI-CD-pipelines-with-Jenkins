# ðŸš€ CI/CD vs Jenkins 

## ðŸ”¹ What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery or Deployment)** is a **workflow or process**, not a tool.

* **CI (Continuous Integration):**

  Every time developers make code changes, the new code is automatically tested and merged into the main project.

* **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):**

  After successful testing, the code is automatically deployed to the server (staging/production).

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **CI/CD = A process for automatically building, testing, and deploying software.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is a popular **tool** that helps implement the CI/CD process.

* You create **pipelines/jobs** in Jenkins.

* Whenever code is pushed to **GitHub/GitLab**, Jenkins detects the changes.

* It then automatically **builds, tests, and deploys** the application.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* **CI/CD = Concept / Workflow**

* **Jenkins = Tool to implement the concept**

---

## âš¡ Why the distinction matters?

* **CI/CD (Workflow/Idea):** Defines *how* code will be built, tested, deployed, and errors detected.

* **Jenkins (Tool):** Executes that workflow in practice. 

Example: Push code â†’ Jenkins triggers build â†’ Runs tests â†’ Deploys app.

---

## âœ… Summary 

* **CI/CD = The idea (workflow/process)**

* **Jenkins = The tool to make it happen**
